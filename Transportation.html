        <h3 class="sub-title">Student Card</h3>
        <p>
            In Haarlem, the Netherlands, the student card is a vital identity document for students, offering a range of savings on local services, cultural events, and transit. You must be enrolled in a Haarlem-based educational facility, such as a university or technical college, in order to receive the student card. If your school does not automatically provide student cards at the start of the academic year, you can apply through the student services department of your establishment. Generally, you'll need to present documentation that is current (like a passport or ID card), proof of enrollment (such a student registration certificate), and a recent passport-sized photo if needed. You could have to pick up your card in person or receive it by mail, depending on the institution. The student card has several advantages, such as reduced rates on local and NS train tickets, entry fees to museums and cultural events, and exclusive deals at participating stores, eateries, and cafes. All things considered, having a student card in Haarlem improves your time as a student by offering more discounts and advantages!        </p>
